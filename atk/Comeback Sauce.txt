Why This Recipe Works
Somewhere between a remoulade and Thousand Island Dressing, this spicy southern condiment gets plenty of kick from hot sauce, mustard, black pepper, paprika, and garlic. Ketchup and chili sauce add sweetness, raw onion lends some bite, and Worcestershire and lemon juice brighten it up. We process the sauce in the food processor for a silky texture, then keep it in the fridge to spread on sandwiches, use as a dipping sauce or salad dressing, and—our favorite—serve with fried catfish.
