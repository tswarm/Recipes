Ingredients:

1 lb chicken breast or thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cornstarch
2 eggs, beaten
Oil for frying
Honey Garlic Sauce:

1/3 cup honey
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 tbsp rice vinegar
1 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 2 tbsp water (slurry)
Instructions:

Heat oil in a deep skillet or fryer to 350°F (175°C).
Coat the chicken pieces in the flour and cornstarch mixture, then dip them into the beaten eggs, and coat again with the flour mixture.
Fry the chicken in batches until golden brown and crispy, about 4–5 minutes per batch. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
In a small saucepan, combine honey, soy sauce, garlic, and rice vinegar. Bring to a simmer over medium heat.
Stir in the cornstarch slurry and cook until the sauce thickens, about 1–2 minutes.
Toss the fried chick
